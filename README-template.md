### What I learned

In this project i learned about Bootstrap grid and utilities to optimize landing page development with agility.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/) - This helped me for structure of this landing page reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Bootstrap utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/) - This is an amazing article which helped me for development with agility. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
